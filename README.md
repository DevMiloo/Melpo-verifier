**Email:** milothefurryy@gmail.com
**Discord:** `milo_dev`
**Discord support server:** [official Support Discord](https://www.discord.gg/jjGAwwwxZz)

## **2. Purpose of Data Use**

We collect and process personal data to provide the bot’s core functionalities, including:

-   Verifying users within Discord servers.
-   Welcoming verified users (if enabled).
-   Managing automated server functions.

The bot does not use the collected data for any purpose beyond those described above.

## **3. Legal Basis for Processing**

We process your data based on the following legal grounds:

-   **Consent:** By setting up the bot and enabling its features, you provide consent to store and process necessary data.
-   **Legitimate Interest:** Processing is required to fulfill the functionality of the bot in your Discord server.

## **4. Access to Personal Data**

The data is primarily processed by **Melpo Verifier** during its operation to fulfill its features. The bot does not share data with any third parties.

As the system administrator, **Team Melpo** has administrative access to the stored data for maintenance, troubleshooting, or updates. Server administrators and authorized users also control how the bot interacts with the data through bot settings and commands.

Access is limited to these purposes, and data is not used for any unauthorized activities.

## **5. International Data Transfers**

The data the bot collects is saved on servers in the United States. This, therefore, means that your data is sent outside the European Union to be processed and stored. We ensure that the processing of all data meets the relevant data protection legislation and regulations.

In addition, Discord itself may operate servers in regions outside the European Union. For further details on how Discord handles data, it is recommended that you review [Discord’s Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

## **6. Retention Period**

The Melpo Verifier bot retains data for specific durations based on its purpose. The following outlines how and when data is deleted:

1.  **Server Configuration:**
    
    -   Includes channel IDs, role IDs, verification questions, content of customisable messages.
    -   **Retention Period:** Retained until 7 days after the bot is removed from the server or the `/reset` command is executed by a server administrator.
2.  **Invite Logs:**
    
    -   Tracks the invite link used by a user to join the server.
    -   **Retention Period:** Automatically deleted after 30 days or after handled application.
3.  **Opt-Out Status:**
    
    -   Tracks whether a user has opted out of answering verification questions in a specific server.
    -   **Retention Period:** Retained indefinitely unless manually deleted by request or through the Opt-In button.
4.  **Message IDs for Verifications:**
    
    -   Includes message IDs related to verification processes.
    -   **Retention Period:** Deleted immediately after handled application.
5.  **Cached Data:**
    
    -   Temporarily stores server-specific and user-specific data to improve performance and minimize repeated API access.
    -   **Retention Period:** Cached data is retained as long as the bot is running and has access to the data, typically until the bot restarts, the cache is manually cleared, or the data is removed from the cache by the bot (e.g., through specific actions like message processing).

## **7. Your Rights**

As a user, you have the following with respect to your personal data:

-   **Access:** You have  the right to request an electronic copy of the personal data that is specifically associated with you, such as your verification status, messages, and any opt-out preferences you’ve set.
-   **Correction:** You may request that any inaccurate or incomplete data related to you is corrected.
-   **Erasure:** You can at any time request the deletion of your data.
-   **Objection:** Under  certain  conditions,  you can object to the processing of your data.  

To  invoke  any  of  these rights, please contact us with the information  provided  above.

## **8. Mandatory Data Provision**

Using the Melpo Verifier bot requires certain data to function. If this data is not provided (e.g., channel IDs or role IDs), the bot cannot perform its functions.

## **9. Automated Decision-Making**

The Melpo Verifier bot uses automated processes to perform certain actions, such as assigning roles and sending verification or welcome messages. These processes are based on simple, predefined server rules set by the server administrator. There is no complex profiling or decision-making involved. All actions are triggered by the configuration chosen by the server administrators and are not based on any personal characteristics or behavioral analysis.

## **10. Data from Third Parties**

All information the bot processes is provided through Discord’s platform. This includes but is not limited to user IDs, server-related info (e.g., channel and role IDs), and other basic data required for the bot to function as intended. This data is used solely for verification processes and server management features.
The bot does not collect or process data from external third-party sources outside of Discord's platform. Processed data will not be shared, either, with any third-party entities.
